# üóÉÔ∏è TextureUnpacker

## Overview

TextureUnpacker is a Node.js tool written in TypeScript which can be used to unpack `.png` sprite sheets packed with [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/) into separate sprites if provided with corresponding `.json` or `.plist` data file.

### Supported data formats:

- JSON (Array)
- JSON (Hash)
- Phaser (JSONArray)
- Phaser (JSONHash)
- Phaser 3
- PixiJS
- Cocos2d-x
- Cocos2d
- Cocos2d v2 (old, CocoStudio)

## Contributing

If you have noticed a bug or would like us to support additional data formats, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/pavle-goloskokovic/texture-unpacker/issues) describing said bug or requested format (and provide matching sprite sheet and data files), or even better [open a pull request](https://github.com/pavle-goloskokovic/texture-unpacker/pulls) with code changes which fixes the bug or adds support for new data format.

## Dependencies
- [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp)
- [plist.js](https://github.com/TooTallNate/plist.js)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/pavle-goloskokovic/texture-unpacker.git
$ cd texture-unpacker

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run TextureUnpacker tool
$ npm run unpack [<path>] [<format>]
# Options:
#  path    Directory or sprite sheet path/name       [string] [default: '']
#  format  Data format type ('json' or 'plist')  [string] [default: 'json']
```

## Example

We have sprite sheet and data files `Sprite.png`, `Sprite.json`, and `Sprite.plist` available in the `example` directory. The tool assumes that sprite sheet and data files have the same name with different extensions.

Running the command below will read `json` data file, create `Sprite` directory at the same level as the sprite sheet file, and populate it with individual sprites:

```bash
$ npm run unpack example/Sprite.png json
```

In case we have multiple data formats available, like in this example, you can explicitly provide `plist` as the second argument to give it precedence:

```bash
$ npm run unpack example/Sprite.png plist
```

Omitting the format argument in the command above will use `json` data since it is the default expected format:

```bash
$ npm run unpack example/Sprite.png
```

In case you have only `plist` data file available, the above command would work the same since the tool can automatically detect available data file.

You can also omit the sprite sheet extension `.png` when running the tool, but if you plan to run it repeatedly this might have undesired behavior since providing `example/Sprite` as the first argument will give priority to the generated `example/Sprite` directory, rather than to `example/Sprite.png` sprite sheet file:

```bash
$ npm run unpack example/Sprite
```

Providing directory path as the first argument will scan provided directory for `.png` sprite sheets with accompanying data files to unpack:

```bash
$ npm run unpack example
```

And finally, omitting the path argument completely will scan the entire project structure to find all available `.png` sprite sheets with accompanying data files to unpack:

```bash
$ npm run unpack
```

TODO: Update README to properly document added usage options
rough documentation:

my personal powershell alias to run from any directory:

```bash
function Texture-Unpacker ($1, $2){
    $dir = pwd
    echo "running command 'npm run --prefix `"path_to_texture-unpacker`" unpack "$1" "$2"'"
    npm run unpack $dir"\"$1 $2 --prefix path_to_texture-unpacker
}
```
new usage option (assumes using an that mimics the above):

```bash
unpack dataFile.json
```

this takes in a json file packed by TexturePacker for Phaser3 and uses the "image" property to properly locate and read the associated texture files. each file is then unpacked into its own folder of the same name as each image property. I'm hoping to change this to allow dumping all unpacked texture files into one folder with a name matching the json data file, but that's a very low priority.
